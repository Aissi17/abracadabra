Sound recogniser

Mostly to see whether it's possible, this is a project to identify sounds from a finite set. The current plan is to divide it into the following modules:

Sound recogniser
Sound storage
Sound classifier

The classifying is currently being written in Python for ease of development but may switch to another language if and when needs change.

The classifying of tracks will require performing a fourier on each time interval (to be decided) in the track and identifying amplitude peaks in different sections of the resulting transform.

This is an idea coming from the talk Over The Air Identification at FOSDEM 2016.
